# responsivewebsite
Followed a youtube tutorial in order to learn how to make a responsive website.

I followed a youtube tutorial by Kevin Powell on how to make a responsive website.
Learned many new tricks and though it might have been a "simple" way of making things, I found it to be really efficent and rewarding to learn, especially for someone who has just started to learn html and css. 

I choosed this project because I think it's crucial to make websites equally good on all devices.
Also as an exercise to use and learn Github more. 

There isn't any content on the site yet, except for the things that was provided in the tutorial.
